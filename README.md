# Crunchbase Project - SQL 
This is going to describe what I did during this project.
**SQL** is used to write the codes and the *mode.com* is used for the presentation initially.

# Project Definition: 

Investing Analysis:  “What type of companies should we fund?”
    Hypothesis: We are a Venture capital aiming to have an understanding on what type of companies (e. g. health, ecommerce, software)  they should invest in the coming year and if they should branch out to regions outside of EU.
