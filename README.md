# Crunchbase Project
This project, completed during my data analysis course, serves as a representative sample of the coding and project work I've undertaken. I aim to showcase my skills and experiences by including it in my GitHub repository.

During this project, I utilized **SQL** to write the necessary codes for data manipulation and analysis. Additionally, **mode.com** served as the initial platform for data visualization, contributing to the comprehensive presentation of project insights.

# Project Definition: 

Investment Analysis Focus: "Identifying Ideal Investment Targets"

Hypothesis: As a venture capital firm, our goal is to discern the optimal sectors (e.g., health, e-commerce, software) for investment in the upcoming year. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of expanding our investment portfolio to regions beyond the EU.


Below outlines the steps I took to reach the ultimate decision. Striving for innovation, I devised a scoring tool to evaluate diverse criteria. This tool facilitates decision-making aligned with our objectives. It allows us (the venture capital firm) to compare and determine whether any of the initial factors undergo changes.

## Source of Data 
While actively engaged on the *mode.com* website, I utilized data accessible from there. The website, along with its datasets, is freely available for use up to a limited timeframe. Consequently, the SQL codes I authored contain file addresses configured in a manner that ensures seamless execution when run on *mode*, taking full advantage of its functionalities.

The information available on this website is dated, with the latest data being from 2014. Consequently, for the purpose of this investigation, we are assuming the current date to be November 2014. Our objective is to gain insights into the data up to this assumed date.
